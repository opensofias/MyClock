# MyClock
a visual clock with freely configurable units of daytime.

## usage
so far, configuration is done purely by hardcoding certain parameters. i should make them more accessible some time.

the most important parameter is an array of integers that defines the units of time. for the usual babylonian time scheme this is 24-60-60. or 2-12-60-60 if that's your thing somehow. hexadecimal time is 16-16-16-16, as you would expect.
